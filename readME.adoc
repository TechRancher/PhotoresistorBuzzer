.Description of the project
We will read the value of the photoresistor, then have it take the value and run a buzzer with it.
We are going to have to do some math to get the buzzer to play tones on the point slope. From a
project we did with passive buzzers we learned that we can make good tones from 0.8 Milliseconds to
10 Milliseconds. And we know that our shop lighting had a reading on the photoresistor of 130
when lights are low, and 750 when lights are bright. So, we will plug this into our math slope line
and come up with our formula to use. (0.8,130) to (750, 10) we come up with 
y = (9.2/620) * x -(9.2*130)/620 + 0.8. This is what we will plug into our code to take the light 
reading for our photoresistor and have the buzzer tone from the results.

.Items Needed
* One 5k Ohm resistor
* One Passive Buzzer
* One Photoresistor
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Six jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed one of the photoresistor's leg at column 15 (Note:
the photoresistor has no polarity) and the leg to column 17. I installed the left 
leg of the 5k ohm resistor into column 17 and the other into column 21. I installed
the passive buzzer in column 29 and the other leg into column 26. Now to run the 
jumper wires. I ran GND from the Arduino GND to the breadboard GND rail. I ran
a jumper wire from 5V on the Arduino to column 15. I ran a jumper wire from A0 on
the Arduino to column 17. I ran a jumper wire from 3 (PWM) on the Arduino to column
29. I ran jumper wires from GND rail to column 21, and column 24. 
This should close the circuit.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "PhotoresistorBuzzer.ino".

.What To Expect
Once the code is done and you upload to the Arduino, you are ready to hear the buzz tone
that your shop light will produce. Take your finger and cover the photoresistor to help it
change tones. Move your finger up and down (towards and away) from the photoresistor to 
have a more musical tones. See if you can make it try and stay at one tone. 
Have fun with it and make something!
